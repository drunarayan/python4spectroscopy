### Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks

In this project you will get an overview of Jupyter Notebooks, including 
*  how to write dynamic Markdown syntax
*  how to write embedded and executable Python code
*  how to author equations with LaTeX language
*  how to create line and scatter plots using the Matplotlib and Numpy libraries for Python
*  and much more ...
