    "# Singing Black Hole Activity\n",
    "This coding activity let's us learn how to use Jupyter Notebooks as explore **the singing black hole!**. In 2003 astrophysicists working with NASA’s orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory detected a pattern of ripples in the X-ray glow of a giant cluster of galaxies in the constellation Perseus.  \n",

The sound waves were acoustically equivalent to a B-flat 57 octaves below middle C, a tone that the black hole has apparently been holding for the last two billion years.  Astronomers \"sonified\" the sound from this black hole by increasing its frequency by a factor of 200 quadrillion to 20 Hz, the low limit of human hearing!  \n"
